            <h2>Origins of Jawda</h2>
            <p>
                So back in the way back when, Im getting old kids, right around the time I turned 18 or so...ok a little before, I got my first tattoo. I was that kid who went to a tattoo party got my first tattoo and covered it with a long sleeve shirt for a few weeks so my mom wouldn't notice. It wasn't even fully healed when she did notice, but hey it was permanent by that point. What did I get you ask? Well my initials of course so I would never forget my name <strong>J</strong>oseph <strong>A</strong>ndrew <strong>W</strong>illiams. Well my best friend at the time, and still to this day, started calling me jawda not long after and it just stuck. My love for tattoos has continued to grow, I have seven currently with plans to get many more as finances and time allow. I spent most of my

            <h2>Lover of computers</h2>
            <p>
                As far back as I can remember, I have been obsessed with learning how things work. I started taking computers apart and replacing parts with them at a pretty early age of around eight or nine. By age 10 I was fully hooked on playing games on them. My first pc games included Oregon Trail and SimCity. By age 11 or 12 I had found a book on programming in Basic, it came with a floppy disc to get you started. I remember attempting to write my first games. I gave up not long after, anyone who has coded in Basic will tell you it was not an easy experience. In high school I signed up for a vocational education program which allowed me to learn graphic arts. I dabbled with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark Xpress and learned how to make coffee mugs, notepads and t-shirts. I also made a really creepy demon mouse pad. Fast forward five or six years. I go off to college to learn Auto Body, The Fast and the Furious had been out for a little while and well that is what everyone wanted to do to their cars. I learned one thing during that experience, I was not a fan of manual labor but I did enjoy painting. So I switched my major to Forensics. Seems like the logical path right? Well I wanted to be a CSI or something in a related field or in the CIA, FBI etc. I did that for quite a while, but eventually my home life no longer allowed me to continue. I was a father supporting my children, meant that I had to work a lot. Working a lot meant I couldn't go to campus during the day for labs. So I ended up switching my major again, this time to Computer Science. I ended up getting a Bacholors degree in Computer Science with majors in Information Systems and Internet and Web Technologies. I graduated with around 40 credits more than I needed, but I was finally ready to enter the work force.

            <h2>Nerd or Geek?</h2>
            <p>
                I read somewhere that a Geek is a fan of their subjects, where as Nerds are practitioners of them. I probably lean more towards Geek by that definition. I'm a big Star Wars fan, play Magic The Gathering (I have some nerd qualities), I have watched Dragon Ball Z all the way through around 5 times, I own almost every D&D 5e book and play in a weekly game on Sundays with friends and coworkers. I love going to Comic Conventions, although I haven't read a comic (short of the Vader Comic) in the better part of 10 years. I love to learn, is that weird? Like if I am in a position and the job doesn't challenge me I get bored very easily.

            <h2>Music moves the soul</h2>
            <p>
                I was given my first guitar at some point during middle school. It was a baby blue Fender Stratocastor, I really wish past Joe wasn't an idiot and I still had it. By 8th grade I had joined band at school and started learning drums. I marched in a parade holding quads and quickly learned I was not a fan of marching band. Me and my band teacher made an agreement and I joined jazz band, which allowed me to play a full drumset but more importantly I didn't march anymore and got to play seated. I joined a rock band in 9th grade and we played a few birthday parties but never really took off. By 10th grade I had joined a new band called Loco. I was still playing the drums at this point and we played a lot of high school parties. Being in a rock band in high school was great, you got invited to lots of parties and never paid for drinks ever. I took guitar lessons off and on throughout college and learned that I enjoyed guitar more than drums, although I do still own an electric drumset. Currently I have 3 accoustic guitars, 3 electric guitars, a bass, an electric drumset, a keyboard, and a violin. I picked up the violin because my oldest daughter wanted to learn so we took lessons together for about 2 years, but I haven't really played it since she put it down. Both of my children have played music or did vocals off and on their entire lives. I am almost always listening to music and it has gotten me thru some of the best and worst days of my life. My kids have performed at BB Kings, the Hard Rock Cafe, a few small venues and a wedding. I would say its a huge part of who I am.
